# The Impact of AI and Cryptocurrency Trends on NVIDIA’s Stock Performance

## Introduction

In recent years, the landscape of technology and finance has undergone transformative changes, with companies like NVIDIA at the forefront. As a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has capitalized on the growing demand for advanced computing power driven by artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the cryptocurrency mining boom. These developments have reshaped market dynamics and generated significant investor interest, highlighting the importance of understanding their impact on NVIDIA’s stock performance.

Despite the growing body of literature on the relationship between technological advancements and stock market behavior, there remains a gap in focused analyses of NVIDIA’s stock, especially in relation to events such as AI hype and cryptocurrency trends. Previous studies have addressed these themes in isolation, failing to integrate the effects of both phenomena on NVIDIA’s financial performance. This research aims to bridge this gap by examining how these intertwined events have influenced NVIDIA’s stock over the last five years.

## Research Questions

This study poses the following key questions:
- How have surges in AI interest and cryptocurrency mining activity correlated with NVIDIA’s stock price fluctuations?
- What statistical relationships can be identified between these events and market behavior?

By addressing these questions, this study aims to offer insights into the complexities of NVIDIA’s stock dynamics in relation to broader technological trends.

## Significance of the Study

The significance of this research lies in its potential contributions to both academic and practical realms. By providing a nuanced understanding of how external technological trends affect stock performance, the study offers valuable insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers. Moreover, its findings may inform future investment strategies in an increasingly tech-driven market.

## Methodology

The study employs a range of time series analysis techniques, including:
- Moving averages
- Seasonal decomposition

For forecasting, advanced models are utilized, including:
- ARIMA
- Facebook Prophet
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- GRU
- LSTM

These models are optimized using walk-forward optimization to capture intricate patterns in stock data and provide robust predictions.

## Scope and Limitations

The scope of this study focuses on NVIDIA’s stock performance over the past five years, specifically analyzing the influence of AI and cryptocurrency mining events. However, limitations include potential external factors not considered in the analysis, such as macroeconomic conditions and competitor activities.

The main hypothesis posits that significant correlations exist between NVIDIA’s stock price and the identified technological events.
